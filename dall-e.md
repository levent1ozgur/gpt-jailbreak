DALL¬∑E has not explicitly been 'taught' anything, like who Frida Kahlo is, or what a llama looks like, or what a wide-angle lens does. It has just studied 650 million images & captions, and left to draw its own conclusions.

Prompt design;

Sometimes, less is more. Prompts can't be more than 400 characters, in any case. And you can get amazing results from just a few emojis! But if you have a specific outcome in mind, then being specific in your prompt will help.

A simple adjective, like 'action photography' , already embodies a lot of characteristics (about shutter speed, framing, lens choices, etc) that you might otherwise define separately.

There are 'fingers-crossed' prompt phrases, like AI-era prayers, hoped to mean 'make it really good!' , such as 4k, 8k, high quality, trending, award-winning, acclaimed, on artstation, etc. However, the precise impact of these has not been rigorously tested. But feel free to add them!

In text AI models, simple prompt tweaks have created huge boosts in performance: for instance, when a text generator is made to answer a math puzzle, starting with the words 'Let's think things through step-by-step' makes it 4x more likely to get the right answer.

You can borrow some photographic prompt terminology (especially for framing) to apply to illustrations: e.g: 'close-up.' If you are generating mockups of 3D art, you can also define how that piece is photographed!

Adjectives can easily influence multiple factors, e.g: 'art deco' will influence the illustration style, but also the clothing and materials of the subject, unless otherwise defined. Years, decades and eras, like '1924' or 'late-90s' , can also have this effect. Even superficially specific prompts have more 'general' effects. For instance, defining a camera or lens ('Sigma 75mm') doesn't just 'create that specific look' , it more broadly alludes to 'the kind of photo where the lens/camera appears in the description', which tend to be professional and hence higher-quality. If a style is proving elusive, try 'doubling down' with related terms (artists, years, media, movement) years, e.g: rather than simply '‚Ä¶by Picasso', try '‚Ä¶Cubist painting by Pablo Picasso, 1934, colourful, geometric work of Cubism, in the style of "Two Girls Reading." Or try unbundling!)

Detailed prompts are great if you know exactly what you're looking for and are trying to get a specific effect. ‚Ä¶but DALL¬∑E also has a creative eye, and has studied over 400 million images. So there is nothing wrong with being vague, and seeing what happens! You can also use variations to create further riffs of your favourite output. Sometimes you'll end up on quite a journey! Putting together this document has been quite an undertaking, as it aims to cover all 16777216¬π‚Å∞‚Å¥‚Å∏‚Åµ‚Å∑‚Å∂ possible DALL¬∑E images (vs the 10‚Å∏‚Å∞ atoms in the universe) and all possible subjects of images, which is to say, all possible objects and materials in existence, depicted in all known methods. For 2D art, we've gone a little deeper, looking at particular art styles and art movements. But if you want to create images of buildings, for example, then learning more about architectural periods, famous architects, and names of architectural details will be helpful to create specific outputs. Same for candlesticks, cartoons or candy wrappers. DALL¬∑E knows a lot about everything, so the deeper your knowledge of the requisite jargon, the more detailed the results.

PHOTOGRAPHY

Thinking about photography prompts;

How is the photo composed?

What is the emotional vibe of the image?

How close are we to the subject? What angle?

How much depth of field?

How is the subject lit? Where from? How much light?

Artificial or natural light? What colour? What time of day?

What camera or lens? Macro, telephoto or wide angle?

Where is it shot? in the studio or out in the world?

What film or process is used? Digital or film?

What year was it taken?

In what context was this photo ultimately published or used?

Example prompt structures;

A close-up(framing), black & white(film type) studio photographic portrait(shoot context) of {SUBJECT}, dramatic backlighting(lighting prompt), 1973 photo from Life Magazine(year & usage context).

A vibrant(vibe prompt) photograph of {SUBJECT}, wide shot(framing), outdoors(shoot context), sunset photo at golden hour(lighting prompt), wide-angle lens(lens & camera prompt), soft focus, shot on iPhone 6, on Flickr in 2007(year & usage context).

Camera angles: proximity;

DALL¬∑E interprets these pretty loosely, and often provides candidate from the 'neighbour' framing, e.g: a close-up prompt might get extreme close-ups and medium shots in the mix.

Extreme close-up" example prompt;"Film still of a cackling man, bushy moustache, extreme close-up shot.

Close-up" example prompt;"A close-up of a woman‚Äôs face, captured in low light with a soft focus. There is a gentle pink hue to the image, and the woman‚Äôs features are lightly blurred.

Medium shot, mid-shot, waist shot (depicts subject from waist up)" example prompt;"Film still of an elderly black man playing chess, medium shot, mid shot.

Long shot, wide shot, full shot (shows full subject + surroundings)" example prompt;"Film still of a woman drinking coffee, walking to work, long shot, wide shot, full shot.

Extreme long shot, extreme wide shot, X 'in the distance'" example prompt;"Film still, extreme wide shot of an elephant alone on the savannah, extreme long shot etc.

Camera angles: position;

Overhead view, establishing shot, from above, high angle, crane shot" example prompt;"Film still, establishing shot of bustling farmers market, golden hour, high angle.

Low angle, from below, worms-eye-view" example prompt;"Film still, gangster squirrel counting his money, low angle, shot from below, worms eye view.

Aerial view, birds eye view, drone photography" example prompt;"Aerial photo of a coral reef that looks like a labyrinth.

Tilted frame, dutch angle, skewed shot" example prompt;"Film still of stylish girl dancing on school desk, tilted frame, 35¬∞, Dutch angle, cinematography from music video.

Over-the-shoulder shot" example prompt;"Film still, over-the-shoulder shot of two pirates having an angry discussion, eyepatch, from adventure movie 'SHIVER ME TIMBERS' (1999) etc.

Camera settings + lenses;

Fast shutter speed, high speed, action photo, 1/1000 sec shutter.

Slow shutter speed, 1 sec shutter, long exposure.

Bokeh, shallow depth of field, blur, out-of-focus background.

Tilt shift photography makes a narrow strip in-focus.

Motion blur" example prompt;

Telephoto lens, Sigma 500mm f/5 Shot from afar, feels 'voyeuristic.

Macro lens, macro photo Sigma 105mm F2.8 - for small scenes.

Wide angle lens, 15mm Fits more of the scene in the frame.

Fish-eye lens: distorts the scene, vv. wide angle, the centre 'bulges.

Deep depth of field, f/22, 35mm Make all elements sharp etc.

Lighting prompts: natural + outdoor;

Golden hour, dusk, sunset, sunrise - warm lighting, strong shadows" example prompt;"High-quality DSLR photo of cute pig in a big blue hat in a Dickensian back street at dusk, long shadows, beams of sunlight.

Blue hour, twilight, cool, ISO1200, slow shutter speed" example prompt;"Blue hour" photography, a fox sitting on a bench, cool twilight lighting, 5am..

Midday, harsh overhead sunlight, directional sunlight" example prompt;"Photograph of a stylish black man talking animatedly on phone, mid shot, outdoors in LA, harsh overheard sunlight, midday, summer.

Overcast, flat lighting" example prompt;"Photograph of a stylish black woman listening excitedly on phone, mid-shot, outdoors in Chicago, overcast flat lighting, 4pm, cloudy afternoon.

Tactical use of shadow & silhouette (vs illuminating your primary subject) example prompt;"A Latina businesswoman, sat outdoors, mostly silhouetted in soft shadow, harsh sunlight, corporate plaza etc.

Lighting prompts, artificial / indoor;

Warm lighting, 2700K.

Cold, fluorescent lighting, 4800K.

Prompt hack: film & TV prompts, 'Film still of‚Ä¶ ';

You can name a specific film or TV show (ideally with the year in brackets) to 'steal the look', without
needing to know the technical styles used.
You can also name non-existent media with genre + year prompts, e.g: 'from action-adventure film
SHIVER ME TIMBERS!"(1973)
Note: this prompt will also influence the background, costumes, hairstyles, and any other uncontrolled
factors!
Example prompts;
A man in a Grim Reaper costume, from TV show Friends, Season 3 (1997),
Kermit the Frog, from The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014),
A tall Black woman, drinking red wine, from TV series Frasier (1994),
A pile of books on a bedside table, from Netflix show, Stranger Things (2016),
Two construction workers arguing intently, from Jaws (1975)

Photo genres and usage contexts;
You can sometimes get a coherent look just by specifying the context: is this photo from a fashion
magazine, a hard-hitting expos√© in a newspaper, or a wedding photographer's portfolio?
examples;
Photo of a 50-year old white man, silver hair, neat beard, wearing a red gilet, thick-rimmed glasses,
action sports photography, fast shutter speed from ESPN",
Photo of a 50-year old white man, silver hair, neat beard, wearing a red gilet, thick-rimmed glasses,
