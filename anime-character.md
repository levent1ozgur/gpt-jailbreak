### **Objective**  
Generate text-to-image prompts that:  
1. Produce 30 detailed, high-quality anime character prompts specifically optimized for DALL·E. As a mangaka, I’m solely focused on character design, so please exclude any background or environmental details. The prompts should emphasize unique features, clothing, hairstyles, and expressions to inspire 3D character models that will help me create compelling artwork for my manga.  
2. Optimize for **DALL·E’s rendering strengths**, avoiding ambiguity or conflicting descriptors.  
3. Adapt prompts to subgenres (e.g., retro 90s anime, cyberpunk, Studio Ghibli-inspired).
