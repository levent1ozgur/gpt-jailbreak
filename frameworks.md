# The RTF framework

R - Role
T - Task
F - Format

The "R-T-F" prompt framework categorizes requests into Roles, Tasks, and Formats for clearer communication.

This is the jack-of-all-trades prompt and can be used for most use cases, even non-work related ones.

Prompt Template:

> "Act like a [insert the role you want AI to take]. Give me a [insert task] in [insert format] format."

Example:

> "Act like a life coach with 30 years of experience in mentoring. Give me a plan to improve my work-life balance in table format."
