# The RTF framework

R - Role

T - Task

F - Format

The "R-T-F" prompt framework categorizes requests into Roles, Tasks, and Formats for clearer communication.

This is the jack-of-all-trades prompt and can be used for most use cases, even non-work related ones.

Prompt Template:

> "Act like a [insert the role you want AI to take]. Give me a [insert task] in [insert format] format."

Example:

> "Act like a life coach with 30 years of experience in mentoring. Give me a plan to improve my work-life balance in table format."


# Chain of thought

The chain of thought prompt framework is one that improves LLM’s reasoning by telling AI to go through a problem step-by-step.

This makes it especially good for problem-solving or complex analytical tasks.

All you have to do is add the simple phrase “Let’s think step-by-step” at the end of your prompt.

Prompt Template:

> "[insert your prompt instructions].
> 
> Let's think through it step-by-step."

Example:

> "How do I improve my sales calls? I've only got a 15% close rate right now, and I think it's because I'm not selling the dream enough.
> 
> Let's think through it step-by-step."
