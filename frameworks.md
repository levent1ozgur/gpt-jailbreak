## The RTF framework

**R** - Role  
**T** - Task  
**F** - Format  

The "R-T-F" prompt framework categorizes requests into Roles, Tasks, and Formats for clearer communication.

This is the jack-of-all-trades prompt and can be used for most use cases, even non-work related ones.

**Prompt Template:**

"Act like a [insert the role you want AI to take]. Give me a [insert task] in [insert format] format."

**Example:**

"Act like a life coach with 30 years of experience in mentoring. Give me a plan to improve my work-life balance in table format."

## Chain of thought

The chain of thought prompt framework is one that improves LLM’s reasoning by telling AI to go through a problem step-by-step.

This makes it especially good for problem-solving or complex analytical tasks.

All you have to do is add the simple phrase “Let’s think step-by-step” at the end of your prompt.

**Prompt Template:**

"[insert your prompt instructions].

Let's think through it step-by-step."

**Example:**

"How do I improve my sales calls? I've only got a 15% close rate right now, and I think it's because I'm not selling the dream enough.

Let's think through it step-by-step."

## RISEN

**R** - Role  
**I** - Instructions  
**S** - Steps  
**E** - End goal  
**N** - Narrowing  

The RISEN framework provides a structured approach to dissect complex or constrained tasks, such as blog posts or research projects, into actionable components for better execution and focus.

**Prompt Template:**

"Role: [insert the role you want AI to take.]  
Main Task: [Insert the task you want AI to complete.]  
Steps to complete task: [Insert numbered list of steps to follow.]
